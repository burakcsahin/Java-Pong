# Java-Pong by burakcsahin

I have created a pong clone in Java to improve my knowledge of Java Swing GUI and general GUI design for simple games.
It is free to use, so anyone can download and use it as tutorial material.
If the sound effects are not working, arrange the paths for these files respectively.
